This ASCII diagram shows:
- Two Shelly UNI Plus devices
- Their respective SSIDs
- A WiFi connection line between them
- Simple box borders to clearly separate the devices

To configure a Shelly UNI PLus, connect to the Shelly's SSID with your WiFi enabled device (computer or tablet). Then open a browser to Shelly's IP address (192.168.33.1).

Make the Shelly a part of your home WiFi network (the one that lets you onto the Internet) by adding this WiFi network and password to the Shelly.

In addition, enable Shelly Cloud, so now you can reach your shelly through Shelly Cloud (here:  Connected at shelly-api-eu.shelly.cloud:6022/jrpc or go to https://control.shelly.cloud/ ).

Switch your computer back from the Shelly SSID to your home WiFi network and use either the Shelly App, or Shelly Cloud to act with your Shelly UNI Plus.
