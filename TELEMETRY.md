# Telemetry

https://app.uptrace.dev/

To start sending tracing data to Uptrace, you need to configure OpenTelemetry Tracing SDK. To view and collect metrics, see the Metrics navigation section on the right.

Use the following DSN to configure OpenTelemetry for your programming language:

```
export UPTRACE_DSN="https://4u5UnSF8ck63yJD33QZTrg@api.uptrace.dev?grpc=4317"
```

See [Monitor Flask performance with OpenTelemetry](https://uptrace.dev/get/instrument/opentelemetry-flask.html)
