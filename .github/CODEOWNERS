# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @vanHeemstraSystems/global-owners will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @vanHeemstraSystems/global-owners

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @vanHeemstraSystems/js-owners and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the vanHeemstraSystems team in the vanHeemstraSystems organization owns all .txt files.

# In this example, @vanHeemstraSystems/log-owners own any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like

# In this example, @vanHeemstraSystems owns any file in an apps directory
